# Gravity

An object at position r0 will experience a vector acceleration a due to another body with mass m1 at r1. If there are multiple bodies, the accelerations are added vectorially.

This Python code that implements different approximation methods using object oriented techniques for an arbitrary number of bodies, given an initial position, velocity and a mass for each body.

The appromiation methods used are; Euler's Method, Runge-Kutta Method 2 and Runge-Kutta Method 4. The Euler Method is a first-order numerical procedure that solves ordinary differential equations with with a given initial value. The Runge-Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods.
